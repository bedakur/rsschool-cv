## About me

Curiosity and persererance are my lifestyle, so I strive to learn new things. The more difficult the task seems to me, the more it occupies my thoughts day and night until I find a solution to it. Programming has become an integral part of my life, and I will continue to develop in it. 

## Skills

Python, HTML, CSS, Git

### Sample code

* Python 

```python

def likes(names):
    if names == []:
        return 'no one likes this'
    if len(names) == 1:
        return f'{names[0]} likes this' 
    if len(names) == 2:
        return f'{names[0]} and {names[1]} like this'
    if len(names) == 3:
        return f'{names[0]}, {names[1]} and {names[2]} like this'
    if len(names) > 3:
        return f'{names[0]}, {names[1]} and {len(names) - 2} others like this'
```
